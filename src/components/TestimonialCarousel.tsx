I gained many connections with trainers who were genuinely impressive and did not hesitate to answer my questions even after the course. Now I'm out here grinding for NOI and suffering... but like, in a good way.",

But thanks to the amazing mentors and structured lessons, I actually understood things (crazy, I know). Fast forward: I've won medals at NOI and a bunch of other CP contests. CPIC really gave me the push I didn't know I needed.",
